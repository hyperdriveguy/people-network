# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
This is a small C# program meant to track your relationships (friends/family) similar to the "friends" features of some social networks.
This is meant to be an exercise in learing C# and application of graph theory.
I came up with the idea when I wanted to invite people to a party that were in a certain geolocation and had some additional mutual friend.

In it's current state, you can add a set number of people and have regurgitated back to you.
As of yet, no relationships (edges on a graph) are implemented via this program.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

This program was developed using the Kate text editor on Linux.

This was programmed in C#. I found out quickly I'm not a fan of C# and how it is too similar to Java.
C# development on Linux is possible, but don't expect to write any decent cross-platform graphical application.

Due to all this, this program is a console application that requires `dotnet` to run.
It uses only built in libraries and should be cross-platform.
